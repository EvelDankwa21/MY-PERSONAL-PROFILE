        <h3>Evelyn Asante Dankwa</h3>
        <p>
          I am an ambitious and detail-oriented IT professional with a strong foundation in software development, systems analysis, and digital strategy.
          My passion lies in leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, streamline business processes, and deliver user-centric solutions that drive impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background in Information Technology and experience in both frontend and backend environments, I bring a versatile skill set to the table.
          I specialize in crafting responsive web applications, optimizing system efficiency, and managing technical projects from conception to completion.
          My toolkit includes technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, and frameworks such as React and Django.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I thrive in collaborative environments and value clear communication, creative problem-solving, and continuous learning.
          I’m deeply interested in emerging technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity — and how they shape the future of digital transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am seeking new challenges where I can contribute to innovative projects, grow my technical expertise, and be part of a forward-thinking team.
          Whether you’re looking for a committed developer, a tech-savvy collaborator, or someone who brings vision and execution together — I’d love to connect.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Let’s build something remarkable together.</strong>
